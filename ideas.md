## Spurious Correlations
A common mistake made in financial analysis is to first search for correlations, and then create a causal narrative to explain the correlation. This method is risky because correlations frequently exist between causally disconnected events by mere chance alone.
In order to reduce the chance of finding a spurious correlation, we need to start with a list of major events, and from there make testable hypotheses about the effects of these events on the prices or returns of financial indices.
Only after we have a set of testable hypotheses should we search for correlations which will either support or refute our causal model.
